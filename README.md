About these tools
-----------------
I wrote the majority of these scripts in 2010-11 to support conservation planning activities involving dozens and in some cases hundreds of species and conservation features. Most marxan tools assume a level of manual editing - when considering more than a few dozen conservation features, this can quickly lead to untracable errors. 

The tools were written for ArcGIS 9.2 and 9.3, and as such are badly need of an update for ArcGIS 10. They are also in some cases incomplete, and not thorougly tested. I am publishing them mostly to get them out in public, in hopes that they may be useful to someone else.

Use freely, but use with care given the above caveats. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments
